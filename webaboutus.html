        <p>
            We are a student team of 9 girls and create tote bags and pencil cases from scratch
            to promote a greater awareness of the substantial environmental damage caused
            by fast fashion and the heart-breaking child labour which makes fast fashion possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recycling and reusing means that less of our vital resources like water are used up.
            Not making new clothes has an obviously large positive impact as it reduces our landfill,
            but it would improve the lives of many. Lower strain to make new clothes may go on to reduce
            the amount of young children and desperate people being employed in workhouse/factories that
            exploit them in low income countries.

        <h3>The Harsh Statistics</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>25 000 litres of water required per kilogram of jeans</li>
            <li>The total footprint of clothing in use in the UK was 26.2 million tonnes CO2 in 2016 - up from 24 million tonnes in 2016</li>
            <li>It is estimated that the average garment is worn only ten times before disposal.</li>
            <li>It is estimated that more than half of the fast fashion produced is disposed of in under a year.</li>
            <li>Less than 1% of all materials in clothes are recycled into new garments.</li>
        </ul>
